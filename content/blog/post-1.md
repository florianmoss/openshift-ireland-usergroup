# Welcome!
This post is really meant to give you all a quick summary of what we are doing, why we are doing it and who is organizing it.
We, and with that I mean Murph and me (Florian), strongly believe in collaboration. Knowledge is something that should be open, shared and multiplied. By doing that, everyone will be able to learn, grow and drive innovation. 

This User Group is meant as a platform to do just that.

Every quarter we will host a meet up in Ireland (physically when possible, virtually when neccessary) that will be made up of a variety of sessions. Physical meet ups will include break out sessions and will last 4h-6h while virtual meet ups will last only 2h. If you'd like to speak at our meet ups, please reach out to [Florian](mailto:fmoss@redhat.com).

## Mailing List
Please also make sure that you are subscribed to our [mailing list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/openshift-ireland). 

## Instant Messaging Channel
We are currently evaluating some options here. More information will follow soon!
