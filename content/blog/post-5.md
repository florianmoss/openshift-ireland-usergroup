# Happy New Year and next meetup announcement

We hope that you all had a good start into the new year - the bad news is that we will have to run another meetup virtually, the good news is, we have 2 very exciting talks lined up. 

#### The meeting details in short:
- Date: **19.01.2021**
- Time: **4:00-5:30 pm GMT** 
- Location: **Virtually** (link to be shared)

## Talk 1: Secure Continuous Delivery with Podman, Buildah, Skopeo and UBI
A hands-on demonstration of lessons learned migrating from other container build tools to the RHEL container ecosystem. We aim to explore a set of command-line tools that are able to operate without a container daemon, and namely: Buildah, Podman, Quay and Skopeo.

We will discuss a new set of open-source Container Management Tools starting from a hands-on demonstration. In a nutshell, Buildah builds, Podman runs, Skopeo transfers container images and Quay provides private and public container registries.

Moreover, we will take a look at best practices for building images that can easily be integrated into a CI/CD Pipeline and vulnerability scanning with Clair, thus replacing previous build tools in workflows.

Understand the impact of SELinux, namespaces and cgroups. Move from docker-compose to Podman pods. Build container images for OpenShift Container Platform. Develop and test Ansible Playbooks / Roles with Podman.
